# Model analysis project

**Numerical optimization of the Sharpe Ratio** 

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [XXX]

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires:
     !pip install yfinance
     !pip install pandas-datareader
     !pip install matplotlib inline

**Summary**

In this proect, we use numerical optimization and a simple simulation technique to maximize the Sharp Ratio. By utilizing advanced mathematical algorithms and computational methods, we can search for the optimal combination of assets and weights that generates the highest risk-adjusted return.  

Our model project seeks to combine the classical mean variance model (MVO) which is widely used within the financial portofolio theory, and combine this classical theory with a modern measurement of portofolio risk versus returns. This is done by using the Sharpe ratio in combination with the Markowitz model.

The Sharpe Ratio is a common measurement in finance, it is used to evaluate the risk-adjusted performance of an portofolio. It provides a way to asses the exess return gernerated per unit of risk taken measued by the volatility.
